Nice [technical analysis](https://discourse.odriverobotics.com/t/project-hoverarm/441) of a motor.
Follow links for some nice 128 pole encoder details.
From there:
Motor is 27N30P - equivalent to 9N10P?
This means it has 9 windings for each set of 10 magnets, and 30 magnets total, hence our 90 hall positions.

Nice winding visualisation/[calculator](https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/).
