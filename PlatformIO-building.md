2. Open the Hoverboard directory in your IDE
3. Build it by typing in terminal:
```
pio run
```
4. If you see SUCCESS, that means it built :)
5. or...  hit the build (tick) button at the bottom, or the 'build and upload' (cloud) button if your STLINK is directly connected.

2. cd to the Hoverbot directory
3. Build it:
